If you're looking to understand the basics of Carbon Hack, read below!


üåç **Beyond Carbon, Beyond Limits**

From 18th March to 8th April 2024, developers, engineers, and non-technical practitioners are invited to revolutionize the way we measure software to reduce its environmental impact! 

This year, we're pushing boundaries by going beyond carbon‚Äîexploring the full spectrum of environmental impacts with the [Impact Framework (IF)](https://if.greensoftware.foundation/), an open source Beta measurement tool for measuring software across all components and environments, to reduce the ecological footprint of software.

We‚Äôre challenging practitioners far and wide to showcase IF's prowess in reducing software's ecological footprint‚Äîcarbon emissions, water usage, land impact, and more. This is your chance to make a real impact.


ü§ù **Collaborate and Compete: Unite for a Sustainable Future**

Bring your skills to the table as you form small teams (up to 5), combining healthy rivalry with collaboration. Choose your path:

- Measure the Environmental Impact: Utilize IF to measure and understand the environmental impact of software like never before.

- Enhance the Framework: Contribute code, integrate new models, plug-ins, applications, or documentation to strengthen IF's capabilities.

- Showcase the framework‚Äôs scope: Show how IF can measure various environmental impacts beyond carbon‚Äîwater usage and more.

üåê **Open to All: Democratizing Sustainability**

Sustainability should be open to everyone‚Äîwhich requires the ingenuity and contributions of technical and non-technical practitioners. Carbon Hack is about creating a tool that allows us to collectively measure for action and ensuring the tool is user-friendly, understandable and easy to learn.


üèÜ **Unlock Your Potential: Awards and Cash Prizes Await!**

Carbon Hack offers an opportunity to have your ideas assessed by the best in the business, taking your skills and solutions to new heights. And, winners receive a cash prize and improve their chances of becoming a [GSF Champion](https://champions.greensoftware.foundation/).
