## Welcome to Carbon Hack 2024

<img src="http://i.countdownmail.com/31m3av.gif" border="0" alt="countdownmail.com"/>

üåç **Beyond Carbon, Beyond Limits**

From **18th March** to **8th April 2024**, technology professionals are invited to revolutionize the way we measure software to reduce its environmental impact! 

This year, we're pushing boundaries by going beyond carbon‚Äîexploring the full spectrum of environmental impacts with the [Impact Framework (IF)](https://if.greensoftware.foundation/), an open source Beta measurement tool for measuring software across all components and environments, to reduce the ecological footprint of software.

We‚Äôre challenging practitioners to come together in small teams to showcase IF's prowess in reducing software's ecological footprint‚Äîcarbon emissions, water usage, land impact, and more. This is your chance to make a real impact.
