# Carbon Hack 2024
## How to Support the Carbon Hack

Carbon Hack is nothing without a passionate community of **supporters**, drawn from our sponsors, GSF member organizations, GSF Champions and the wider Green Tech community.

Here are some ways you can help: 

### Submitting project ideas:
Our Impact Framework team have put together a handy template to submit your ideas for participants to choose from. Follow these steps:
1. Check out the prize categories so that your idea can be clearly aligned to one. 
2. Familiarize yourself with the Impact Framework documentation, so that your idea is workable within the capabilities of IF.
3. Review the current [open ideas](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/hack/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aidea).
4. Submit an idea using the [Idea Template](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/hack/issues/new/choose) in this reponsitory.

### Act as a mentor to teams:
We are very keen for folks who have experience and/or expertise in measuring the environmental impact of software to support our teams. Although this hack is all about _Impact Framework_, you do not need to be an IF expert to help!
