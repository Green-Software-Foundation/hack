## Carbon Hack 2024
### Prizes & Judging Criteria

In 2024, Carbon Hack is about how we measure the environmental impact of software, with all hack projects being linked to the Impact Framework.

### The Judging Process
Carbon Hack submissions will close on Friday 15th March at 23.59 GMT (UK Time). After that time, there will be a shortlisting and judging process.

#### Submitting your Project
_Submission Procedure TBC_
The team leader will submit a link to the hack project which should be presented as a GitHub repo. The team lead will also select the relevant category for their submission - only one may be selected. If the team is made up of undergrads, they can also select this category in addition to one of the main categories.

#### Shortlisting
The Shortlisting process will involve a small committee validating that projects are eligible and meet a quality threshold. Valid projects will then be sent for judging in the respective category. 

#### Judging
The judges are drawn from sponsoring organizations as well as nominated representatives of the GSF. They will judge each submission in accordance with the Terms & Conditions **(to be linked here)** and will assess the following qualities per submission.
- Quality of submission / 10
- Ease of Integration into Impact Framework / 10
- Community Impact / 5
- Documentation provided / 5

Judges will assess the submitted project using a form/document provided by the GSF, which will be submitted by Monday 25th March for final validation by the GSF.
