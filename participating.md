# Carbon Hack 2024
## Participation Guide

Welcome to Carbon Hack 2024. It's great that you're interested in taking part. This document is intended as a guide for hack participants. There may be further questions covered in the [FAQ](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/hack/blob/main/FAQ.md).

## üíö What is Impact Framework?
Impact Framework (IF) aims to make the environmental impacts of software easier to calculate and share.

IF allows you to calculate the environmental impacts, such as carbon, of your software applications without writing any code. All you have to do is write a simple manifest file, known as an `impl` and IF handles the rest.

The project is entirely open source and composability is a core design principle - we want you to be able to create your own models and plug them in to our framework, or pick from a broad universe of open source models created by others.

For **Carbon Hack** we are challenging participants to build solutions that align to and extend the capability of IF. 

## üíö I've got an idea, is it any good?

- **Idea criteria**: To have a good idea, you should consider how your idea aligns with the following criteria:
    - **Relevance**: How relevant is your idea to the theme of Carbon Hack 24 and the mission of the Green Software Foundation?
    - **Innovation**: How innovative is your idea in terms of using IF to measure and reduce the negative environmental impacts of software?
    - **Feasibility**: How feasible is your idea in terms of technical, financial, and time resources?
    - **Scalability**: How scalable is your idea in terms of potential impact and applicability to different contexts, industries and domains?
    - **Replicability**: How replicable is your idea in terms of sharing best practices and learnings with other software practitioners and stakeholders?
- **Idea validation**: To validate your idea, you should use the IF tools and resources to estimate the environmental impact of your software solution and compare it with the baseline or alternative solutions. You should also seek feedback from your peers, mentors, and experts on the Carbon Hack 24 platform and community.
