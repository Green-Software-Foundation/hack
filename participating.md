# Carbon Hack 2024
## Participation Guide

Welcome to Carbon Hack 2024. It's great that you're interested in taking part. This document is intended as a guide for hack participants. There may be further questions covered in the [FAQ](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/hack/blob/main/FAQ.md).

## üíö What is Impact Framework?
[Impact Framework (IF)](https://if.greensoftware.foundation) aims to make the environmental impacts of software easier to calculate and share.

IF allows you to calculate the environmental impacts, such as carbon, of your software applications without writing any code. All you have to do is write a simple manifest file, known as an `impl` and IF handles the rest.

The project is entirely open source and composability is a core design principle - we want you to be able to create your own models and plug them in to our framework, or pick from a broad universe of open source models created by others.

For **Carbon Hack** we are challenging participants to build solutions that align to and extend the capability of IF. 
[Post your project team issue](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/hack/issues/new/choose) and add some questions, the IF core team will come and review and offer their feedback. We want you all to be successful. There are also project suggestions that are seeded in the respository which the IF team has already vetted so if you base you project on one of those you know you are in a good position to win the hackathon.

## üíö I've got an idea, is it any good?

We will soon be updating this section with specific guidance per category. In the time being, consider the below:

- **Idea criteria**: To have a good idea, you should consider how your idea aligns with the following criteria:
    - **Relevance**: How relevant is your idea to the theme of Carbon Hack 24 and the mission of the Green Software Foundation?
    - **Innovation**: How innovative is your idea in terms of using IF to measure and reduce the negative environmental impacts of software?
    - **Feasibility**: How feasible is your idea in terms of technical, financial, and time resources?
    - **Scalability**: How scalable is your idea in terms of potential impact and applicability to different contexts, industries and domains?
    - **Replicability**: How replicable is your idea in terms of sharing best practices and learnings with other software practitioners and stakeholders?
- **Idea validation**: To validate your idea, you should use the IF tools and resources to estimate the environmental impact of your software solution and compare it with the baseline or alternative solutions. You should also seek feedback from your peers, mentors, and experts on the Carbon Hack 24 platform and community.


## üíö What prize category should we go for?
#### **Prize categories**: _There are four prize categories for Carbon Hack 24:_
- üíß Beyond Carbon
Any submission that demonstrates the application of Impact Framework beyond carbon. (e.g. water, waste, air quality).

- üì¶ Best Model
A model plugin that best supports and enhances the Impact Framework model plugin ecosystem. 
_If you wrote code in the form of a Model Plugin it's Best Model_

- üìù Best Content
Best piece of content published about Impact Framework, an article, tutorial, video or how to guide.
_If you made some written human language content externally it's the Best Content_

- ‚ú® Best Contribution to the Framework
Best contribution to the Impact Framework tool itself. Adding a new feature or enhancing an existing one.
_If you made a contribution to the if repository is the Best Contrubution._

#### We are also keen to broaden the opportunities for those who are studying:
- üéì Best Undergraduate
Specific prize for Undergraduate Students, drawn from across the main categories.





#### **Prize selection**: To select the prize category that best suits your idea, you should consider the following questions:
- **What is the main goal of your idea?**: 
- **What is the main strength of your idea?**:
- **What is the main challenge of your idea?**: Is it the relevance, the feasibility, the scalability, or the replicability of your idea?
- **Ask initial questions in your project issue** and the hackathon team will make sure to highlight them to the IF team to help answer.
- **If you have broader questions** or want to get feedback from the community ask in the [ask anything channel](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/hack/discussions/categories/ask-anything) in the discussions forum. We would rather you asked questions publically as that helps the most people.

After submitting a project you and all of your team will be added to a mail thread with the hackathon leaders, if you have any quetions you can ask there as well.
